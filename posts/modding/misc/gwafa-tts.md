# Goblin With A Fat Ass - Tabletop Simulator Mod


Goblin With A Fat Ass TTRPG was made by [Tom Bloom](#credits). I made some card graphics, and put it all into a ready-to-play tabletop sim game.

<br/>

tldr; find the game on the steam workshop: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127313330](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127313330) and the repo: [https://github.com/twizzork/gwafa-tts](https://github.com/twizzork/gwafa-tts)

Its a pretty basic setup, so you may find yourself having to add/remove components or making some house rules, but the game is simple and easy to change as you want.

## design process

The most time-consuming bit - making the initial design, then making the cards and making sure they were (mostly) coherent and conforming. I used Affinity Photo and each card was separate. Probably better ways of doing this, like using the TTS template, but I had already started when I found them 🙉

## tabletop simulator process

This process was surprisingly painless. TTS comes with a handy tool called "TTS Deck Editor", which makes it pretty easy to import images and export a deck image, to then import into TTS.

The peeps that made this software will never read this but the TTS Deck Editor could use some QOL stuff:
1. move the grid setup (height/width) to the deck window somewhere, maybe a bar along the top of the new deck UI?
2. if i've saved a deck, don't pester me to confirm when closing a tab
3. fix the issue with the last card in a deck - let me import 8 cards if i make a 4x2 instead of having to import 7 then another 1 without prompting me to make a new deck
